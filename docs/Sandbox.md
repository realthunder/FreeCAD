# The Python sandbox: consolidated reference

Consolidated on **2026-09-03** from six documents written between
2026-08-29 and 2026-09-03 -- `ExpressionSandbox.md`,
`ExpressionSandboxPhase0.md`, `ExpressionImage.md`, `PyodideHost.md`,
`SandboxNetwork.md`, `SandboxGui.md` -- after an audit of every concrete
claim in them against the code at `dfd9336c91` on branch `SecurePython`.
Those six stay in the tree as the historical record (each carries a
banner pointing here); this document is the one to read and the one to
keep current.  Sec 14 says which section of which source went where and
what the audit found stale.

Status tags used throughout: **[built]** exists in the tree and is
tested; **[measured]** a number taken on this box under the stated
conditions; **[designed]** written down, not built; **[decided]** a
user decision, quoted where the wording matters.

## 1. Direction

### 1.1 Why

The expression engine is a hand-written C++ interpreter with no pure
C++ evaluation path: every value is a CPython object (`getValueAsAny()`
is `pyObjectToAny(getPyValue())`, about 128 call sites in
`Expression.cpp`).  Its old protection was a name-matched allowlist run
inside the interpreter it guarded -- a confused deputy: an eight-name
builtin denylist plus a module allowlist by `__module__` prefix, with
the module check on attribute-traversal results commented out.  The
threat the roadmap names is concrete: opening a malicious `.FCStd` runs
code at recompute.

The direction, ordered by the user (2026-08-29): sandbox the engine's
Python before the spreadsheet ships to the browser; define the security
model (who is asking, what can be asked, how the user grants) BEFORE
the mechanism, with grant as first-class as deny (2026-08-30).

### 1.2 The end state **[decided 2026-09-03]**

"Our final goal is to run everything Python in pyodide."  One
preference, `Python/Runtime = native | pyodide`, moves every rung that
is ready into the sandbox; a rung that is not ready falls back to
native with an audit line, never silently.  Pyodide is THE runtime
FreeCAD ships and develops; the WASI image is the reference
implementation, built only on request.

### 1.3 The ladder

Each rung ships alone; each is strictly more Python in the sandbox.

- **Rung 0, expressions** **[built]**: both spreadsheet modes route,
  the corpus gate passes, the budget works.  Routing is preference-gated
  OFF by default (sec 3.5).
- **Rung 1, native dispatch for `call` members** **[designed]**: the
  annotated method set retargeted from Python C API calls to generated
  C++ dispatch, so document principals never touch native CPython even
  indirectly.
- **Rung 2, document-embedded Python** **[designed]**: scripted-object
  `Proxy` code lives in the document's guest; `execute()` is a bridge
  call.  Needs instance-per-principal with a fast spawn, the
  asynchronous loop primitive, and `PropertyPythonObject` restore that
  never instantiates host objects.  `FeaturePython::execute()` calls the
  host Proxy today (`src/App/FeaturePython.h:201`); nothing routes a
  Proxy that lives in a guest.
- **Rung 3, session scripting** **[designed]**: console and macros in a
  session-principal guest with wide grants; needs the bindings pack to
  cover the App-level API, user packages (sec 5), session network (sec
  6).
- **Rung 4, Python workbenches** **[designed]**: App-side logic is rung
  3 work; the GUI residue is sec 7.

The App-core severance (`FREECAD_NO_NATIVE_PYTHON`, an App that does not
link libpython) is the argument-by-compiler for rung 1: chasing link
errors IS the chokepoint audit.  Not started; `ExpressionCore` exists
only as an OBJECT library folded into `FreeCADApp`
(`src/App/CMakeLists.txt:580-601`), explicitly a stepping stone.

### 1.4 Standing rulings

- Expressions are DOCUMENT CODE: gate by principal only, never carve
  out a carrier (2026-09-03).  An expression, a Proxy, an embedded
  script all run as `document:<hash>`.
- Pre-resolve host-side, then FAIL CLOSED: no silent native fallback
  when the image cannot evaluate (2026-08-31).
- Routing stays OFF by default until the corpus regression, not
  judgement, says otherwise (2026-08-31).
- wasmtime stays a SHARED library and a conda package
  (`wasmtime-capi`), decided on the multi-process OCCT direction and on
  more Python moving into the image, not on size (2026-09-01).
- `doCommand` is permission-controlled: runs under the caller's
  principal, never escalates, gated by `gui.doCommand` (2026-09-03).
- The GUI island (native PySide/pivy code) is attributed, not enforced:
  the threat model is document-derived code, which never runs there.

## 2. The security model **[built]**

Modeled on browser origins: wasm guest = sandboxed renderer, host
dispatcher = browser kernel, principal = origin, grant flow = permission
prompt, per-document panel = site settings, PROMPT scoping =
popup-blocker (once / session / always), quotas = tab throttling.

### 2.1 Principals

Three classes (`ExpressionSecurity.h`, `PrincipalClass`):
`document:sha256:<hex>`, `session`, `addon:<name>`.  The C++ core is
not a principal.  A document's identity is content-addressed:
`DocumentHashBuilder` collects every expression, cell and script code
string into a sorted set, joins them with `\x1F` under the prefix
`"fcexpr-v1\0"`, and SHA-256s the result.  Tampering with a trusted
file voids its grants; copying a trusted file's Uid into a hostile one
gains nothing.  Console and script evaluation run as `session`
(`DocumentObjectPyImp.cpp:373` pushes a `Runtime::Scope("session")`).

### 2.2 The catalog (frozen v1, plus one action)

`catalogDefault()` in `ExpressionSecurity.cpp`; addons default to ALLOW
across the board.

    permission        document   session   addon   notes
    ----------------  --------   -------   -----   -------------------------------
    doc.read.self     ALLOW      ALLOW     ALLOW   same-origin rule
    doc.write.self    ALLOW      ALLOW     ALLOW   write_prop + write family, owner only (3.2)
    doc.foreign       PROMPT     ALLOW     ALLOW   the cross-origin wall
    geom.call         ALLOW      ALLOW     ALLOW   cost bounded by budget, not grant
    app.query         PROMPT     ALLOW     ALLOW
    gui               DENY (np)  ALLOW     ALLOW   the only non-promptable cell
    host.import:<m>   PROMPT     PROMPT    ALLOW   per module
    unsafe.getattr    DENY       PROMPT    ALLOW   host-side Python attribute walks
    pkg.install:<p>   PROMPT     PROMPT    PROMPT  an ACTION, never a grant (sec 5.5)
    gui.doCommand     DENY       ALLOW     PROMPT  designed (sec 7), not in the enum yet
    net.*             --         --        --      designed (sec 6), not in the enum yet

The one deliberate compatibility break: `unsafe.getattr` (the
`obj.Proxy.foo` drill-down through a live host object) is DENY for
documents by design.  The corpus (sec 8.3) has zero such uses.
`host.import` classifies modules: `math`, `re`, `_sre`, `collections`,
`builtins` are free (ring 0); `FreeCAD`/`App` is `app.query`;
`FreeCADGui`/`Gui` is `gui`; everything else is
`host.import:<name>` (`ExpressionSecurityRuntime.h:342-344`).

### 2.3 Grants

- Scopes: once, session, always.  `PermissionNeeded` fails fast; a
  recompute is never blocked on a prompt.  A denial crosses the wire as
  a plain `Base::RuntimeError`, not `PermissionNeededException` (tests
  rely on the difference).
- Store: `<UserAppData>/security/grants.json` (schema v1) with a sibling
  `audit.log`; `GrantStore`, `AuditLog` in `ExpressionSecurity.h`.
- Headless: `--grant <permission>[:<target>]` (repeatable) and
  `--policy <file>` (a grants.json used instead of the user store),
  `Application.cpp:2586-2587`.
- Preference `Expression/Security:Enforce` (default true) switches
  enforcement off for rigs that measure parity, not policy.
- Python: `FreeCAD.ExpressionSecurity` -- `principal`, `grant`, `revoke`,
  `grants`, `pending`, `principalOf`, `resolve`, `clearOnce`,
  `clearPending`, `enforced`.

### 2.4 Enforcement point

Host-side only, never in the guest: `ExpressionSecurityRuntime.h`
compiles every `check*` to a no-op under `FC_EXPR_IMAGE`, so the guest
cannot contain enforcement even by mistake.  The permission service was
wired into the old chokepoints rather than replacing them:
`ImportModules::getModule` calls `checkModuleImport`
(`Expression.cpp:2375`), `CallableExpression::securityCheck` keeps the
eight-name denylist and adds `checkCallablePermission`
(`Expression.cpp:4490-4530`), `Component::get` calls `checkGetattr`
right above the still-commented-out module check it supersedes
(`ObjectIdentifier.cpp:653-671`).  `getvar`/`hasvar` and
`Base::Interpreter().getVariable` were deleted, not disabled.  Every op
over the wire carries its principal and passes the schema check, then
the permission check, on the host.

### 2.5 The panel and the padlock **[built 2026-08-30/31]**

`Gui::Dialog::DlgDocumentPermissions` (591 lines): per-document grants
with the four verbs (grant, deny, inspect, revoke), once/session/always
scopes, a `PermissionIndicator` and a `SandboxIndicator` status-bar
padlock whose click toggles routing, warns when routing is on with no
runtime present, and offers the pyodide runtime download when none is
installed.  A `pkg.install:<name>` row's allow button runs the
installer (sec 5.5).  Any roadmap text that still lists "the
permissions panel" as future work is stale; the remaining panel work is
adding rows for the network permissions.

## 3. Architecture **[built]**

### 3.1 The boundary

Architecture B: the Python value layer moves into the sandbox; OCCT and
the Document stay host-side.  Architecture A (a C++ value path that
de-Pythonizes arithmetic) was measured NOT to be a prerequisite (sec
8.1).  The AST walker itself is compiled into the image ("image-walk";
"host-walk", one crossing per operator, was rejected).

`ExpressionCore` (`Expression.cpp`, `ObjectIdentifier.cpp`, `Range.cpp`)
compiles into the image behind `FC_EXPR_IMAGE` against an adapter world
(`ExpressionImage/FcxDocument.{h,cpp}`) that keeps the host's class
names (`App::Document`, `DocumentObject`, `Property*`,
`PropertyContainer`, `PropertyLinkBase`, about fifteen methods) so
`ObjectIdentifier.h` needs no change.  Host-only code -- the security
chokepoints, `DocumentObjectPy`/`ExpressionPy` type checks, the
maintenance overrides of `VariableExpression`/`RangeExpression` -- is
compiled out.  One source list, `ExpressionImage/ImageSources.cmake`,
feeds both guests (the WASI reactor and the pyodide extension module).

Three rings: ring 0 is in-image native (CPython, the core, Base math
bindings, a stdlib slice); ring 1 is generated facades for host types;
ring 2 is absent (`os`, `socket`, `ctypes`: no grant supplies them).

### 3.2 The wire (`FcxWire.h`)

Ops: `eval`, `exec`, `read_prop`, `get_attr`, `call`, `get_item`, `len`,
`release`, `resolve_alias`, `pkg.missing`, `write_prop`, `mod_call`,
`mod_get`.  The module facades (2026-09-04, `MODULE_FACADES` in the
generator, sec 3.3): the guest's `Part` module is a closed list of
names -- 30 callables (`LineSegment`, `makePolygon`, `Face`, ...), one
constant (`OCC_VERSION`), one exception (`OCCError`) -- built at init
into the guest's `sys.modules`; a callable is `{op:"mod_call", m:
"Part.LineSegment", a, k}` run on the host with handle arguments
dereferenced, its result crossing by value or as a handle with the
annotated facade above it; a constant is read once over `mod_get`; the
exception is a guest-local class the bridge raises whenever a host
reply names it (`raiseFromReply` consults the facades' `EXCEPTIONS`
after the builtins).  Gate `Permission::GeomCall`, a decision: a
curated constructor list is a geometry call, where `_part` (an
arbitrary import) is `host.import`.  An undeclared name is not on the
guest module at all (AttributeError), and a forged `mod_call` is a
protocol error.  `exec` (2026-09-04,
host->guest, `ImageHost::exec(source, module)`) runs statements; with a
module name the source becomes that module in the guest's `sys.modules`
(created and registered before it runs, bound to its parent package
when dotted, removed on failure) -- how the host pushes workbench
Python into the guest while there is no package loader for it (the
DraftVecUtils gate today, G1's Draft loader later).  Value tags: `quantity`,
`vec`, `rot`, `pla`, `mat`, `bb`, `h` (handle), `tup` (a tuple crosses
as a tuple, the first corpus-gate finding).  Reply shape `{ok, val}` or
`{ok:false, exc, msg}`.  The one write op is `write_prop` (2026-09-04,
`{op, h, a: name, v: value}`, the proxy's `__setattr__`): the handle
must be the EVALUATION OWNER -- `HandleTable::owner()`, set by
`evalExpression` and by a raw `eval` that names one; rung 2 writes self
and nothing else -- under `doc.write.self`, then the C++ property
system's `setPyObject` (typed; a shape re-maps its element map), never
host Python.  `Immutable` refuses, as native `setattr` does; `ReadOnly`
is the editor's status and writes through it succeed natively, so they
do here too (the gate is parity, not extra policy).  The value
decodes through the handle table, so a host object crossing back as a
handle dereferences to the live object (a `PropertyLink` takes the
object, not its wire face).  `addProperty`, `removeProperty`,
`setPropertyStatus` are declared `call` members (DocumentObjectPy.xml,
PropertyContainerPy.xml -- the facade chain now reaches
PropertyContainer through ExtensionContainer) and ride the `call` op
behind the same owner-only gate.  Refusals are `PermissionError`, not
`ProtocolError`: the request is well-formed, the principal is not
allowed.  The read path never enters host Python
(`read_prop` is answered from the C++ property system); host CPython
runs only for members annotated `call`.  Arguments validate against the
XML-declared signature; a sandbox callable is never a valid argument.

Handles are transaction-scoped and decoded BEFORE `clearHandles()`.
Releases are deferred for one transaction and applied at the start of
the next: the spreadsheet idiom `tuple(.cells, <<B4>>, <<ZZ4>>)` returns
a tuple whose first element IS a host object, and the image destroys
its proxies as the evaluation unwinds -- before the host decodes the
reply -- so an eager release turned the handle into a stale id.  The
flush DECREFs under the GIL, only when an interpreter exists
(`e2969a8503`; this paragraph existed only in that commit message
before).

The bindings pack: identifiers are pre-resolved host-side
(`getIdentifiers()`/`getDeps()`) and shipped with the request as values
or handles, so a pack hit costs zero crossings; on a miss the real
`resolve()`/`access()` run against the adapter world.  Failures ship
too (`binderrs`), but only for identifiers naming a document other than
the owner's -- a blanket "ship every failure" would break in-eval bound
variables (`a = Width + 1; a * 2`).  The pack resolves the WHOLE
identifier host-side, which is why link placements, `getSubObject`
walks, `_shape`, `_self` and indexed group access evaluate identically
native and routed.

### 3.3 Generated facades

`src/Tools/bindings/generateSandboxFacades.py` reads
`<Sandbox tier="value|handle|call"/>` on the `*Py.xml` members and
emits ONE `FcxDispatch.inc` (host) and ONE `FcxFacades.inc` (a Python
source string for the image) from the same list, so the two guests
cannot drift.  Absent means DENY: a new binding is unreachable until
annotated, and the security review of the bridge is "diff the
annotations".  Until 2026-09-04 that was 14 members in five XMLs; G1
step 5 grew it to 239 members across 50 facades in 50 XMLs, the
Draft App-side surface of sec 7.6 (`--surface`): the nine TopoShape
bindings, Geometry/Curve/Surface and the concrete curves and surfaces
Draft touches, Geometry extensions, BaseClass (`TypeId`,
`isDerivedFrom`), Document/DocumentObject/PropertyContainer reads and
the write family.  Value classes (Vector, Rotation, Placement, Matrix,
BoundBox, Quantity) need no annotation: they cross by value and exist
in the guest.  The list lives ONLY in the generator (`ANNOTATED_XMLS`,
fathers first -- an XML with no annotation of its own, Persistence or
TrimmedCurve, is listed so the Father chain reaches through it); the
two CMake custom commands take their DEPENDS from `--list-xmls` so
nothing drifts.

Two traps the growth uncovered.  A facade's key must be the RUNTIME
`tp_name`, and Part renames all nine TopoShape types at module init
(`AppPart.cpp`: TopoShapePy becomes `Part.Shape`, then `Part.Edge`,
`Part.Solid`, ...), so the XML-derived `Part.TopoShape` never matched
a live shape and every shape fell through to `read_prop` -- that was
the caveat recorded in the crossing analysis, not a python-mode quirk;
`RUNTIME_TYPE_NAMES` in the generator carries the nine, and
`merge_same_key` folds any genuine collision into one facade (the
union of members; a member the object lacks raises AttributeError
from the host as natively).  And a facade is verified only by real
guest Python on a real object
(`ExpressionImageEvalTest.partSurfaceOnHandles`), never by reading
the XML.

### 3.4 The evaluation seam

`src/App/ExpressionEvaluator.{h,cpp}` is the single seam, deliberately
NOT in `ExpressionCore` and deliberately at the CALLERS rather than
inside `getPyValue` (the 12x hop cost makes per-node routing absurd).
Re-entrancy during an image evaluation runs natively (thread-local
guard); the AST is not re-parsed host-side.  `SandboxStatus` /
`sandboxStatus()` (`ExpressionEvaluator.h:72-96`) is a cheap preference
read plus two stats; `confined()` is host built, image present, routing
enabled.  `ImageHost::evalCount()` counts crossings; `ImageHost::stats()`
(2026-09-04) counts them by kind -- evaluations, handles minted, and
every guest->host op by wire name -- with `resetStats()` to zero them.
That is the instrument for G1a: run a Draft or Arch `execute()` in the
guest, read `FreeCAD.ExpressionSandbox.stats()['ops']`, and the
read_prop/get_attr/call counts say where a snapshot op would pay
(sec 8.1) before one is designed.

### 3.5 The router: what is routed

Preference `Expression/Sandbox:Evaluate`, **OFF by default**.  Routed:
expression evaluation, the spreadsheet through the single seam
`PropertySheet::eval` (and its `evalPy` twin) -- python mode CROSSES
rather than being refused, since python mode is a lexer state plus
builtins visibility, both in the image -- with `OptionCallFrame` /
`OptionPythonMode` crossing in the request; paste-as-value,
`setContent`, `EditQuantity`, `Cell::getPyValue` in EditNormal,
`DlgSheetConf` range validation.  NOT routed: the GUI live expression
editors (`DlgExpressionInput`, `SpinBox`, `InputField`, `PropertyItem`)
-- policy-gated as session, not confined; a named future slice.
Writes were never the router's problem: `PropertyExpressionEngine::
execute` sets the path on the host after the value returns.

Python: `FreeCAD.ExpressionSandbox` -- `routed`, `setRouting`,
`available`, `imageInfo`, `evaluate`, `evaluateNative`, `evalCount`,
`stats`, `resetStats`, `reset`, `pyodideReleases`, `pyodideLayout`, `pyodideVerify`,
`pyodideAbi`; constants `OptionCallFrame`, `OptionPythonMode`.

## 4. Runtimes **[built]**

`ImageRuntime` (`ExpressionImageRuntime.h`) is the seam; two
implementations register by name.  Selection (`runtimeChoice()`,
`ExpressionImageHost.cpp:69-83`): preference `Expression/Sandbox:Runtime`,
else environment `FCX_RUNTIME`, else `"pyodide"` when the pyodide host
is compiled in (the normal build), else `"wasi"`.

### 4.1 pyodide on a bare V8 (the default) **[built 2026-09-02/03]**

Three pieces: the engine is `v8-embed`'s `libv8.so` (V8 14.6, built
out of node 26.6.0's tree by `realthunder/v8-embed-feedstock` as a bare
engine: no node modules, no default context, five conda platforms plus
Windows from source); the shim is `src/App/PyodideHost/host_shim.js`
(291 lines), the minimal d8-shape surface pyodide's loader needs --
`console`, `read`/`readbuffer`/`load`, `os.system` (a string-matched
RNG hook), `crypto.*`, `performance.now`, timers and `queueMicrotask`,
`TextEncoder`/`TextDecoder`, `URL`, `btoa`/`atob`, `self` -- and
NOTHING else: no `process`, `require`, `module`, `fs`, `fetch`,
`XMLHttpRequest`, `Worker`, `WebSocket`, `MessageChannel`; the native
surface is `PyodideRuntime` (`ExpressionPyodideRuntime.cpp`), which
installs `readText`/`readBytes`/`randomBytes`/`now`/`print` on
`__fcx_host` plus the dynamic-import and import-meta callbacks.
Confinement is by construction: what the guest can reach is what the
shim defines.  `PyodideProbe.cc` is the standalone probe binary only.

Boot and call: `pyodide_glue.js` provides `__fcx_boot(root, wheel,
packagesDir, names)`, `__fcx_link()`, `__fcx_setInterrupt`,
`__fcx_teardown`.  The transport (2026-09-04) is the wasi reactor's
own shape on both sides, with no JavaScript in the path: guest->host is
the pair of wasm imports `fcx_host_call(ptr, len) -> reply length` /
`fcx_host_fetch(dst, cap)` (ImageBridge.cpp, module `env` for the side
module, `fcx` for the reactor), installed as V8 natives and merged into
the main module's symbol table with `Module.mergeLibSymbols` BEFORE
the wheel loads, so the dynamic linker binds the side module's imports
to them; the native reads the request out of `Module.HEAPU8` in place.
Host->guest is the side module's `fcx_alloc`/`fcx_call`/`fcx_free`
exports (ImageModule.cpp, `EMSCRIPTEN_KEEPALIVE` plus
`-sEXPORTED_FUNCTIONS`), taken from `Module.LDSO.loadedLibsByName`
and called from C++ as wasm functions.  `HEAPU8` is re-read per use:
memory growth replaces it.  The earlier shapes -- a Python callable
returning bytes (a proxy per crossing, 40 us of floor), then two
bytearrays viewed through `PyProxy.getBuffer()` -- are gone, along with
`set_host`, `set_host_buffered`, `buffers`, `grow_request`,
`call_len` and `__fcx_call`.  The guest wheel
`fcx_image-<ver>-cp314-cp314-pyodide_2026_0_wasm32.whl` is
`_fcx_image`, the same `ImageSources.cmake` compiled by the pyodide
toolchain (emsdk 5.0.3, pyodide-build 0.39.0) with `-fPIC
-fwasm-exceptions -sSUPPORT_LONGJMP=wasm -fvisibility=hidden -flto`,
linked `-sSIDE_MODULE=2 -sWASM_BIGINT`; it must be an `add_executable`
with a `.so` suffix, not `add_library(MODULE)`, which CMake's Emscripten
platform would archive with `emar`.  `-fvisibility=hidden -flto` cut the
wheel 427 to 368 KB and the hop cost by a third.

The time budget (both runtimes): two stages, a soft interrupt through
CPython's emscripten signal handling on a shared `int32` buffer, then a
hard `Isolate::TerminateExecution` (wasmtime: epoch interruption);
`Expression/Sandbox:BudgetMs` 5000, `GraceMs` 1000; outcomes
`Interrupted` / `Terminated`; `Watchdog` in
`ExpressionPyodideRuntime.cpp:389-517`.  Budget overhead: WASI transport
floor 2.6 to 3.1 us; pyodide inside run-to-run noise.

Still open: a memory ceiling for a guest (no `MAXIMUM_MEMORY` handling).

### 4.2 The WASI image (the reference) **[built 2026-08-30/31, frozen]**

Built only with `BUILD_EXPR_WASI_RUNTIME` (default OFF), fixed when
broken, never extended.  Toolchain: wasi-sdk 33 (the floor:
exceptions-enabled libc++) to 34 (the ceiling for CPython's
`wasm32-wasi` target name), wasmtime v48.0.1 CLI and C API, CPython
3.12.13 from `Tools/wasm/wasm_build.py wasi`.  `ExpressionImage/
CMakeLists.txt` is a standalone cross project; `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`
defaults to Release -- an early build left it empty, ran -O0, and every
number taken before that fix was 3 to 6x too slow (sec 8.1).  Flags:
`-fwasm-exceptions -mllvm -wasm-use-legacy-eh=false`,
`-mexec-model=reactor`, `-DFC_NO_QT`, `-DBOOST_DISABLE_THREADS
-DBOOST_SYSTEM_DISABLE_THREADS`.  Real in the image: Type, BaseClass,
Vector3D, Rotation, Matrix, Placement, DualQuaternion, Quantity, Unit,
Exception, PyObjectBase, GeometryPyCXX, the seven `*PyImp.cpp` binding
TUs, PyCXX; stubbed in `ImageStubs.cpp`: console to stderr, the
internal unit scheme only, a trace counter.

Transport: `fcx.host_call` / `fcx.host_fetch`, a two-call
size-then-fetch under wasmtime linker module `fcx`; image side
`_fcx.op(name, id, ...)` with a `HostHandle` proxy; host side
`HandleTable` and `dispatchHostOp`, permission checks before the object
is touched.

Packaging (`c105d058e6`): `tools/pack_image.py` strips the 34 MB build
(28 MB of it DWARF and names) to 10.9 MB (3.1 MB gzip) plus a 16-file
320 KB stdlib slice, and emits the desktop layout `<datadir>/Fcx/
{fcx_image.wasm, Lib/}` from the same list; `install(...)` rules
exist.  Resolution (`WasmtimeRuntime::resolve`): `configure()`, then
preferences `ImagePath`/`StdlibPath`, then `FCX_IMAGE`/`FCX_STDLIB`,
then `<datadir>/Fcx`.  The compiled-module cache lives in `<user
cache>/ExpressionSandbox/<name>-<FNV-1a of the image path>[-budget]
.cwasm` (the image directory is read-only after an install); a
precompiled module instantiates in about 19 ms against about 600 ms of
JIT.  `cMake/FindWasmtime.cmake` greps `wasmtime/config.h` for
`WASMTIME_CONFIG_PROP(void, wasm_exceptions`; `libwasmtime.so` has no
SONAME, so the imported target sets `IMPORTED_NO_SONAME`, which CMake
honours only on a target it knows is SHARED; `FREECAD_BUNDLE_WASMTIME`
defaults ON when the library is outside the prefix and the system
directories.

Two traps from the build: two `nlohmann::json` copies (3.11.2 vendored,
3.12.0 conda) collide in exported symbols with `json` in the signature;
and the v1 catalog ALLOWs addon principals, so a test that expects a
refusal must use a document principal.

### 4.3 The browser tier **[built 2026-08-31, on the WASI image]**

The stripped image runs in the page under pack-first evaluation with
the bridge deliberately NOT attached (a synchronous import cannot await
a Promise); a formula being typed is previewed without a host round
trip.  Needs the exnref exception proposal: Firefox 131+ and Chrome
137+ ship it, Chrome 123 needs `--experimental-wasm-exnref`.  Numbers
(Firefox 136, -O0 image, never re-taken on Release): fetch 128 ms,
compile and instantiate 268 ms, init 31 ms, 140 us per evaluation;
page-load-to-preview 1042 ms dominated by the 10.9 MB fetch.  The
browser tier has not moved to pyodide; where its packages would come
from is sec 6.4 territory, designed only.

### 4.4 Rejected: pyodide hosted by node **[measured 2026-09-01]**

Conda does ship an embeddable engine (`nodejs`, `libnode.so`, 71 MB)
and the boundary is fast (host hop 3.0 us against the WASI bridge's
then-quoted 31.6 us -- really ~7 us, sec 8.1), but a node-hosted
pyodide cannot be confined by subtraction:
after `del globalThis.process`, `js.Function('return
import("node:fs")')()` is still a full read-write escape, because
dynamic `import()` is a V8 realm intrinsic; node's permission model
blocks `process.binding`, which pyodide's own loader uses.  Hence the
bare engine of sec 4.1.  One correction worth keeping: node's JS module
loader and emscripten's `WebAssembly.instantiate` wheel linking are
orthogonal, so "no wheels ever" was the WASI image's own limit, never
pyodide's.

## 5. Bootstrap and packages **[built 2026-09-03]**

### 5.1 Layout

    <user app data>/Pyodide/
        current                 one line: the version that boots
        <version>/              pyodide.js pyodide.mjs pyodide.asm.mjs
                                pyodide.asm.wasm python_stdlib.zip
                                pyodide-lock.json package.json
        packages/               the user's wheels under lock-file names
            manifest.json
    <datadir>/Pyodide/wheels/   fcx_image-<ver>-cp314-cp314-pyodide_<abi>_wasm32.whl

`App::ExpressionSandbox::Pyodide` (`ExpressionPyodide.{h,cpp}`) is the
single owner of these facts: `releases()`, `layout()`,
`verifyDirectory()`, `scopePath()`, the lock lookups,
`missingImport()`.  Overrides: preferences `PyodideUserDir`,
`PyodidePackages`; environment `FCX_PYODIDE_USER`,
`FCX_PYODIDE_PACKAGES`.

### 5.2 Resolve order

Runtime directory: explicit `configure()`, preference `PyodideDir`,
`FCX_PYODIDE`, the user-data `current` marker, `<datadir>/Pyodide`.
Wheel: explicit, `PyodideWheel`, `FCX_PYODIDE_WHEEL`, an
`fcx_image-*.whl` beside the runtime, the shipped wheel whose ABI tag
matches (`wheelForAbi`), `<stdlib>/fcx_image.whl`.  A wheel whose tag
does not match the runtime's `abi_version` is refused at boot.

### 5.3 The pinned table

One entry: version `314.0.6`, ABI `2026_0`, CPython 3.14.2; the six
runtime files with sha256 (npm CDN and GitHub core tarball agree byte
for byte); the core tarball `pyodide-core-314.0.6.tar.bz2` with its
hash.  `initialize()` verifies version and every file hash (about 14
MB, tens of milliseconds, once per instance) and REFUSES anything else;
`FCX_PYODIDE_UNPINNED=1` or preference `PyodideUnpinned` turns the
refusal into a warning that repeats on every boot.

### 5.4 Scoping, and the one trap

The reader and the module loader are confined to three canonical roots
-- the runtime directory, the wheel's directory, the package set --
compared component by component after following symlinks,
case-insensitively on Windows, understanding `file:///C:/x`; never one
widened parent.  **Pyodide's shell-mode `resolvePath` is the
IDENTITY**: `packageBaseUrl` never reaches the reader and the loader
asks for a lock-file wheel by its bare file name, so a relative name
resolves against the runtime directory first and the package set
second (`scopePath`'s `fallbacks`), existing entries only.  A dev tree
stages numpy beside the runtime, so a test that boots from the staged
directory passes vacuously; the offer test boots from a copy holding
only the pinned files.

### 5.5 The installer and the offer

`freecad.pyodide` (`src/Ext/freecad/pyodide/__init__.py`), host Python:
`releases()`, `layout()`, `default_version()`,
`install_runtime(version=None, source="github", progress=None,
make_current=True)` with sources `github` (the 6.8 MB core tarball,
verified, six files read out by name), `jsdelivr` (npm, file by file)
or a local tarball/directory; `list_runtimes()`, `remove_runtime()`,
`set_current()`; `install_package(name, source="index", progress=None,
requested_by="session")` resolving `name` and its `depends` against the
active runtime's lock, depth first, fetching from
`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/pyodide/v<ver>/full/<file>` or a local
mirror, verifying sha256, writing atomically, rewriting
`manifest.json` (`version`, `runtime`, `abi`, `packages`,
`load_order`); `remove_package()`, `list_packages()`, `manifest()`;
exceptions `RuntimeUnsupported`, `DownloadError`, `VerificationError`.
Downloads go through the Addon Manager's `NetworkManager` with a GUI,
`urllib` headless.  Nothing runs at startup.  A name not in the lock
raises "PyPI packages are not supported yet".

Boot loads `fcx_image` then `loadPackage(names)` in manifest order; a
manifest for another ABI is ignored with a warning.  The offer: a
`sys.meta_path` finder appended LAST asks the host one op,
`pkg.missing {a: name}`; the host answers from the lock's import map
(304 names): installed -> `ImageHost::scheduleReset()` and the next
evaluation boots with the package; else
`Runtime::requestPending(PkgInstall, name)` records a pending request,
audited as a prompt.  The panel's allow button runs
`freecad.pyodide.install_package(name)`, resets the sandbox
(`App::ExpressionSandbox::resetSandbox()`), and recomputes the blocked
objects -- the same re-run path a grant takes.  Not built: in-place
install into a running guest (P2), PyPI sources (PEP 783
`pyemscripten_<abi>` wheels), the pre-run import scan (dropped: an
`import` fails at the guest's import with the same offer).

## 6. Network **[designed 2026-09-03, nothing built beyond the demotion]**

Ground truth: a guest has no sockets by structural absence; the shim
defines no `fetch`, `XMLHttpRequest` or `WebSocket`.  The threat that
network adds is exfiltration, server-side request forgery against the
user's LAN, and beaconing, so the gate is by destination.

### 6.1 Shape

Two injected primitives -- a synchronous `XMLHttpRequest` (what
`urllib3`'s emscripten backend and `requests` use) and an asynchronous
`fetch` completing through the pumped task queue -- both forwarded as
one bridge op, `net.http.request`, to a host `NetClient` behind an
interface (leaning libcurl; Qt Network the fallback if the certificate
store check fails on the Windows and macOS conda builds), after
`NetPolicy::check`.  Redirects re-check every hop; the resolved address
is checked, not only the name.

### 6.2 Grammar and built-in denials

Targets are origin patterns `[scheme://]host[:port]`: a hostname
matches itself; `*.example.com` matches subdomains, never the apex; a
bare `*` is refused (the wide grants are the only "everything"); port
omitted means the scheme's default only; scheme omitted means `https`,
`http` written out.  Deny entries use the same grammar and always win.
Always denied, openable only by an exact-address user allow: loopback,
private ranges (10/8, 172.16/12, 192.168/16, fc00::/7), link-local and
the cloud metadata address 169.254.169.254, unspecified and multicast,
and any destination whose RESOLVED address lands there (DNS rebinding).

### 6.3 Defaults and limits

    permission          document    session   addon
    ------------------  ---------   -------   ----------------
    net.http:<origin>   PROMPT (a)  ALLOW     PROMPT, "always"
    net.http.any        DENY        ALLOW     PROMPT
    net.http.local      DENY        PROMPT    PROMPT (b)
    net.ws:<origin>     N4          N4        N4
    net.socket          DENY        N4        N4

    (a) through the panel, never a document-opened dialog; GET/HEAD
        unless widened.  (b) never persisted past the session.

Limits, not permissions: a 64 MiB response cap, timeouts from the
remaining budget, one in-flight synchronous request per guest, per
principal request and byte counters with a passive-indicator threshold;
`Outcome::Terminated` cancels in-flight requests.  Grants live in the
existing `GrantStore` (generic over `Permission`, no schema change);
one audit line per verdict.  Documents never get network by default;
an addon declares its origins in a manifest the Addon Manager can show.

### 6.4 The browser tier

The same policy runs in the page's shim as defense in depth; the
browser's CORS decides what connects; whether the served-document
server should proxy allowed origins is a separate design.

## 7. GUI for sandboxed Python **[designed 2026-09-03; the linter built]**

The user's framing: "since our final goal is to run everything Python in
pyodide, eventually we'll need to find a way to expose GUI function ...
my current thought is to have some kind of bridge, or PySide shim, so
that we don't expose PySide to user code directly."  The test named:
port Draft and BIM (Arch is folded into BIM in this fork).

### 7.1 The decision: FreeCAD's API, not Qt's

A shim that speaks Qt's API is one synchronous hop per property read
(Electron removed exactly that as its `remote` module), is a denylist
over the process, has to be re-implemented over DOM for the browser,
and preserves accidents like building Coin nodes to draw a dimension.
The shim speaks FreeCAD's API, generated as facades with a permission
per op (`gui`: DENY document / ALLOW session and addons):

- **U1 Registration** (data): `addCommand`, `addWorkbench`, icon and
  language paths, preference pages.
- **U2 Host services** (one op each): message/question/input dialogs,
  the file dialog (an `fs` grant), cursor, clipboard (grant),
  `defer(ms, callback)`, hints, plus the ops the linter found missing:
  `openUrl` (a grant), a status-bar message, a theme query,
  `preferences.show`, and composed icons `icon.swatch(color, shape)`
  and `icon.overlay(base, badge)`.
- **U3 Forms**: sec 7.3.
- **U4 Selection, view, edit**: `Selection.*` with observers as
  events, camera get/set, pick queries, `setEdit`/`resetEdit`,
  `runCommand`.  `doCommand(src)` is an eval primitive: it runs under
  the CALLER's principal in the caller's guest, never escalates, and is
  gated by `gui.doCommand` -- DENY document (not promptable), ALLOW
  session, PROMPT addon persisted per addon -- with an audit line
  carrying a hash of the source **[decided]**.
- **U5 The scene**: sec 7.2.
- **U6 Tools**: the 3D event stream (Coin events serialized to guest
  callbacks, coalesced per frame) and the snapper.  The snapper's move
  to C++ stands on cost (its per-move work is geometry queries against
  host shapes) but is deferred: no longer a correctness blocker.
- **U7 Compatibility**: a `PySide`-named module in the guest covering
  the data-level subset (translate, icon references, `Qt` enums, the
  static dialog calls, `QTimer.singleShot`, value types), and the
  porting linter.

### 7.2 The scene: pivy in the guest, mirrored **[decided: "can we just port pivy over to wasm in full? I don't see any security problem with that"]**

Coin and `pivy.coin` compile into the guest; Draft builds real Coin
graphs there; the host replicates them into its scene through a
mirror, field changes coalesced per frame, the widget protocol of 7.3
as the wire (a node is a model whose traits are its fields; the model
classes are generated from Coin's field introspection the way pythreejs
generates from three.js).  All 555 pivy uses in Draft and BIM port
unedited, including the ghost trackers' `writeInventor -> SoInput`
strings, and desktop rendering does not change because the host scene
holds the same nodes.  The user's reading on security is right: Coin
inside the guest exposes nothing; the boundary is the mirror reader,
which enforces a node-type allowlist (nothing carrying a file path or
code: `SoFile`, `SoTexture2` by filename, `SoImage`, `SoWWWInline`,
`SoShaderObject`, `SoCallback`, VRML script and inline nodes), quotas
on node counts and inline texture bytes, a structured wire of type
name plus typed fields (never Coin's Inventor parser on untrusted text
on the host), and a check that a selection node's document path belongs
to the principal.  Reads of the HOST scene (`getSceneGraph`, camera
node, pick, bounding-box and search actions, about 30 uses) stay ops;
FreeCAD's own node types created by name (`SoBrepEdgeSet` x9,
`SoFCSelection`, `SoDatumLabel`, `SoSkipBoundingGroup`) get guest
stand-ins.  Cost: the Coin fork has no emscripten support (Boost
headers, OpenGL, X11, with GLX and EGL behind options); native pivy is
34 MB with symbols, so the guest grows by roughly 15 to 20 MB of wasm.
Probe A (sec 11) decides between real Coin and a Coin-shaped model
library; both keep the mirror.

### 7.3 Forms: the Jupyter widget protocol **[decided: "the Jupyter + pythreejs pair is very fitting for us. I'd like to grow on it"]**

U3's wire is the Jupyter widget protocol (comm open, state as key-value
diffs, binary buffers, custom messages; about forty core models
specified attribute by attribute; two model-side implementations,
ipywidgets in Python and xwidgets in C++).  Guest side: ipywidgets
unchanged in the package set plus a comm shim of about a hundred lines
over the bridge (`comm.create_comm` / `get_comm_manager`, as xeus and
JupyterLite's pyodide kernel do; JupyterLite already runs ipywidgets on
pyodide from a Web Worker).  Host side: widget managers we write -- Qt
first -- plus a FreeCAD widget module registered on both sides for
quantity inputs, a selection input (Fusion 360's `SelectionCommandInput`
shape), color buttons, and a tree/table model widget with typed cells
(the QStandardItem panels of BIM).  `.ui` stays the AUTHORING format:
the guest parses it for object names and classes, the host manager
reads the same file for layout (Qt through `uic`, exact); the U7
subset gives models Qt-flavored accessors so the 25 `loadUi` panels
port with little edit.  Only host-registered model names render; a
widget package's own JavaScript is never loaded; an unknown model is a
labeled placeholder.  No webview escape hatch for now (if the browser
tier ever needs one, MCP Apps is the shape).  Caveats: traitlets is
heavier per attribute than a hand-rolled model; the `HTML` and `Output`
widgets are browser-shaped, native managers support a subset.

### 7.4 The toolkit transition **[decided]**

No Python toolkit has both a Qt and an imgui backend (Dear PyGui,
imgui_bundle, pyimgui are imgui only and immediate mode; Toga has the
shape but neither backend; Slint's royalty-free license requires
attribution and is GPLv3 otherwise).  The transition goes through the
managers: the Qt manager first, then a Qt-free manager over bgfx for the
same models, drawn in the 3D viewer and identical in the browser viewer
-- the first shipped step of retiring Qt.  For its renderer RmlUi is
preferred over Dear ImGui (the ipywidgets `Layout` model is CSS flexbox,
which RmlUi implements; imgui would need Yoga plus a retained walker;
imgui is vendored under bgfx, RmlUi is not); decided on a measured
prototype when that manager is built.

### 7.5 What the linter found (`scripts/sandbox_gui_lint.py`)

Run with `.conda/freecad/bin/python3` (Draft and BIM use `match`;
system Python is 3.8).  It buckets every PySide/pivy/FreeCADGui use in
Draft and BIM by longest prefix in a table that is the design above as
an allowlist; `--surface` reports the App-side API members a set of
files uses against the `<Sandbox>` annotations; `--list FILE`, `--all`,
`--no-edit`, `--ui`, `--json`, `--self-test` (25-use fixture).  Live
numbers, 467 files (Draft 243, BIM 224; 19 + 49 `.ui`):

    bucket         uses   files   meaning
    -------------  -----  -----   -------------------------------------
    subset         2187    189    U7 covers it, no edit
    U1              335    169
    U2              310     75    includes composed icons, openUrl, status, theme
    U3             1504    125    forms, including the tree/table model widget
    U4              846    192
    U4.doCommand    247     47
    U5              503     29    Coin, mirrored: ports unedited
    U6              243     62    event callbacks, the snapper
    unmapped        107     33    the residue

    files: clean 189; no edit 118 (112 subset-only, 6 mirror-only);
    form or tool work 127 (10 of them also mirrored); with residue 33.
    Files needing an edit 160 of 467; uses needing an edit 1854, of
    which 1504 are forms.

The residue is event filters and synthetic events (19), BIM state hung
on the `Gui` module (11), filesystem calls (9), rich text in ArchReport
(8), host-scene reads (about 20 across handles, actions and cameras),
an MDI-area walk in WorkingPlane (4), Quarter handles (4), this fork's
live-import switches (4): rewrites in the files that own them or
host-scene query ops, no protocol gap.  The work list is led by forms:
`ArchPrecast.py` (108 U3), `ArchReport.py`, `DraftGui.py`,
`ArchComponent.py`, `ArchCoveringGui.py`, `ArchWindow.py`.  The `.ui`
subset the managers must render: 41 widget classes, 16 of them
FreeCAD's own `Gui::` widgets, the `Pref*` family a third of custom
instances.

Draft's App side (`draftobjects`, `draftgeoutils`, `draftfunctions`,
`draftmake`, 97 files) reaches the GUI through exactly three names:
`QT_TRANSLATE_NOOP`, `QTimer.singleShot`, `getViewDirection`.  BIM's
`Arch*.py` files hold object, view provider and panel together; G1
loads them whole with the subset present.

### 7.6 G1 sized: Draft's App side in the guest

`--surface` over that App side: 187 distinct declared members, 4231
reads (TopoShape 41 used / 5 annotated, GeometryCurve 18, BoundBox 17,
TopoShapeEdge 17, Vector 17, DocumentObject 13 / 2, Rotation 13,
Document 12 / 2, Placement 12, ...), 32 `Part` module names (374 uses),
16 `FreeCAD` names (692 uses, `Vector` 332).  Status 2026-09-04: the
`write_prop` op and the write family are BUILT (3.2); the 187-member
surface is ANNOTATED (3.3: 239 members, 50 facades) and proved on
handles from the guest (`partSurfaceOnHandles`: 31 expressions over a
box and its sub-shapes, curves and surfaces -- handle-tier attributes,
value-tier reads, declared calls with handle arguments dereferenced,
booleans between two handles -- each equal to the host's own answer on
both runtimes).  The `Part` module facade is BUILT (3.2: 30 callables,
`OCC_VERSION`, `OCCError`; gate `partModuleFacade`, 14 constructions
and reads equal to native on both runtimes, the exception mapped).
Still missing: a `FreeCAD` module facade for `ActiveDocument`/
`Console`/`ParamGet`, rung 2, and a local-wheel source in
`install_package`.  Document-level writes (`addObject` 76 uses,
`removeObject`) are NOT declared: they are what Draft's make_* commands
do, not what an `execute()` does, and rung 2 writes self only -- a
decision to revisit with G1c.  NOT missing, checked 2026-09-04: the
guest-native value classes.  The
in-image `FreeCAD` module has carried `Vector`, `Rotation`,
`Placement`, `Matrix`, `BoundBox` and `Units.Quantity`/`Unit` since the
core carve (ImageDispatch.cpp), so the 1.6 k vector operations never
hop.  Gate passed on both runtimes
(`ExpressionImageEvalTest.draftVecUtilsInGuestZeroHops`): DraftVecUtils
pushed into the guest UNMODIFIED through the `exec` op (its
`draftutils`/`freecad.deprecation` imports stubbed -- those pull PySide
and the parameter store, G1b's loader problem), all 23 public functions
evaluated in the guest and on the host from the same source, results
within 1e-12 (wasm libm included), `stats()` showing zero bridge ops
and zero handles.  Plan: G1a the surface
(gate: every public `draftgeoutils` function run in the guest on
handles, results equal to native); G1b the Draft wheel and the loader;
G1c rung 2 for one principal (gate: one Draft Wire's `execute()`
byte-identical); G1d the Draft and BIM test documents recomputed with
routing ON.  Three decisions pending before G1a: annotate as `call` now
(host CPython) with rung 1 later; Draft in the addon guest rather than
a per-document guest; geometry values bound to the wasm value layer
rather than pure Python (proposal: wasm, because byte-identical shapes
is the gate).

### 7.7 Decisions, numbered

1. `.ui` as the form language -- amended: the authoring format; the
   runtime model is the widget tree (7.3).
2. The snapper to C++ -- stands on cost, deferred.
3. Dimension view provider to C++ -- WITHDRAWN (7.2).
4. `doCommand` permission-controlled, never escalates -- stands.
5. G1 before G2 -- stands.
6. pivy in the guest, the scene mirrored (7.2).
7. The Jupyter widget protocol is U3's wire, ipywidgets the guest
   library (7.3).
8. The toolkit transition goes through the managers (7.4).

## 8. Measurements

All on this box (6 cores, `conda-relwithdebinfo-801`); the bench gtests
(`ExpressionImageBenchTest`) are `DISABLED_*` and run by hand, so
these numbers are not CI-checked and can drift.

### 8.1 Evaluation cost

    what                                  native   WASI (Release)   pyodide (final)
    ------------------------------------  -------  ---------------  ---------------
    transport floor                       --       2.68 us          5.4 us
    wire floor (eval "1")                 --       12.8-15.7 us     22.2 us (was 30.6-37.6)
    parse + eval arithmetic               2.03 us  13.36 us (6.6x)  18.6 us (was 23.6)
    one property read                     ~3.0 us  20.92 us (7.1x)  29.7 us (was 37.1)
    one bridge hop (marginal, read_prop)  --       7.1-7.3 us       6.2-7.4 us
    pack per eval (export+proxy+release)  --       +23 us           +27 us (was +44)
    instantiate + first eval              --       14 ms (.cwasm)   ~1.5-1.7 s

The pyodide "was" figures are the bytearray/getBuffer transport; the
current ones are the short-circuit of 2026-09-04 (sec 4.1: wasm
imports bound to V8 natives, exports called from C++), which took the
JavaScript out of both directions.  It cut the round trip by about 9
us and the per-eval pack cost by 17 us; the marginal hop itself moved
within noise (~7 us either way), because what remains of a hop is the
guest's CPython `__getattr__` + `_fcx.op` + CBOR (~3 us) and the host
dispatch (GIL, handle table, property read, security, encode, ~3-4
us), not the crossing.  A fixed-layout codec (1-2 us) is the only
transport-side saving left.
    native Shape.Volume / BoundBox.ZMin   179/183 us (mass properties, not
                                          materialization: a TopoShapePy
                                          attribute read is ~1 us native)

The hop row was re-taken on 2026-09-04.  Every earlier figure for it
(WASI +31.6, pyodide +136.8 / +72.1 / +78-80 us) came from a bench that
reused ONE bindings pack across iterations: the guest copies the pack
into per-eval globals and releases the handle when those die, the host
flushes that release on the next call, so every iteration after the
first timed a stale-handle ERROR round trip.  The bench now builds a
fresh pack per iteration, asserts success inside the loop, and reports
the marginal hop as a slope over 1 and 4 reads of `o.Width` (the proxy
does not cache: `__getattr__` crosses every time).  The pack row is
what a raw `eval` with one object binding adds over the wire floor and
includes the release hop.
Pyodide's stages for the first two rows: first transport 40.5 / 89.0 us;
buffered 8.4 / 39.0 us; after `-fvisibility=hidden -flto` 5.4 / 30.6
us, "about 2x the WASI image".  The verdict from the WASI numbers:
architecture A is not a prerequisite; a 10k-cell arithmetic sheet
recompute projects to 0.25-0.31 s from 0.13 s today.  Every number
taken before the Release fix (2026-08-31) was 3 to 6x too slow; the
browser 140 us figure is one of those and was never re-taken.

### 8.2 The corpus gate

`scripts/expr-switchover/{corpus_regression.py, run_gate.sh,
summarize_gate.py, packaging_check.py}`: one `FreeCADCmd` subprocess
per file with a hard timeout (a single 7.7.2-to-8.0.1 forced-recompute
file can stall a whole-corpus sweep for ten minutes), enforcement OFF
in the rig (parity, not policy), paths passed through the environment
(real corpus paths contain quotes and backslashes; `FreeCADCmd` exits 0
when the script raised, so a missing summary file is the failure
signal).  Final state on WASI (2026-08-31): 372 files, 335 expressions
compared, 0 differ, 2 both-error with matching text, 2 timed out;
`scanner.FCStd`'s 73 expressions all match.  On pyodide (2026-09-02):
350 files, 334 compared, 332 same, 0 differ, 2 both-error, 1 timed
out -- the same result set.  Two parity gaps the gate could not see
(literals crossing at 15 digits, error text) were found and closed on
2026-09-02 (`f062e51e80`).

### 8.3 The corpus

456 documents under `~/works`, 7628 expressions, 362 unique strings
(2026-08-30): member reads 302, engine-builtin calls 57, foreign-document
references 69, pure arithmetic 34, one pseudo-property, one dotted
module call, zero `.Proxy` drill-down, zero `import_py`, zero `eval`.
Function frequency: `hiddenref` 29, `dbind` 17, `str` 10, `tuple` 7,
`trunc` 6, `tan` 4, `atan` 2, `sum` 2, `vector`, `ceil`, one
`_math.degrees`, one `Vector.getAngle`.  The King IFC model contributes
1742 x 4 (its `.Shape.BoundBox` bindings, 5808 cells, are host-side
TopoShape materialization the sandbox does not add to -- a handle
protocol could answer BoundBox from a host cache without building a
TopoShapePy at all); the CNC project contributes nearly all foreign
references; scanner.FCStd holds the only sub-shape drill-down.
Non-ASCII object names occur in real files.  Rig:
`scripts/expr-phase0/`.

## 9. Tests

The acceptance harness opens a real saved-and-reopened `.FCStd` under a
real `document:sha256` principal and runs hostile expressions through
every layer.  Suites green at `fd14ba2878`: C++ 536/536, Python 2630.
Every gtest and the corpus gate select a runtime per process through
`FCX_RUNTIME`.

## 10. Configuration reference

## 11. Roadmap, one list

In order; each step ships alone.  Done: Phase 0 audit (2026-08-30),
Phase 1 image and router (2026-08-31), the pyodide runtime and budget
(2026-09-02), N0 demotion, P1 bootstrap and offer, G0 linter
(2026-09-03).

1. **G1** -- Draft's App side in the guest, four stages (7.6), after
   the three pending decisions.
2. **G2** -- U1 + U2 + U7: Draft and BIM register from the guest; the
   subset shim.  No dependency on G1; in parallel if hands allow.
3. **Probe A** -- Coin and pivy to wasm: compile the Coin fork with emcc
   (no GL, threads, fonts), build `pivy.coin` with the guest toolchain,
   time the boot and a 10 k-node graph.  **Probe B** -- ipywidgets in
   the package set, the comm shim, five widgets rendered in Qt from a
   guest script; boot cost and per-event latency.
4. **P2** -- in-place install into a running guest (the sec 9.3 probe of
   `SandboxNetwork.md`: does a wheel with compiled extensions import
   synchronously without `loadPackage`?).  Moved after G1: nothing
   built depends on it and a fresh guest boots in about 1.5 s.
5. **N1** -- `NetPolicy`, `NetClient`, `net.http.request`, the
   `XMLHttpRequest` shim, the user-level allow/deny preferences, the
   audit line.  Test: `requests.get` against a local server from a
   session guest, denied from a document guest, redirect hops.
6. **PyPI sources** for `install_package`, written once against N1's
   client.
7. **G3** -- U3 over the widget protocol: the Qt manager, the FreeCAD
   widget module, the `.ui` loader on both sides.  Gate: every Draft
   and BIM task panel opens from the guest and round-trips its fields.
8. **G4** -- the mirror: generated Coin models, the reader with its
   allowlist and quotas, host-scene query ops, stand-ins, the event
   stream.  Gate: the Draft test documents render identically (pixel
   compare on a converged scene).
9. **N2** -- `fetch` and the loop primitive.  **N3** -- network rows in
   the existing permissions panel, the addon manifest at install time.
   **N4** -- WebSocket (`net.ws:<origin>`), and `SOCKFS` under its own
   `net.socket` permission.
10. **G5** -- the snapper in C++, when measured to matter.  **G7** --
    the Qt-free manager over bgfx (no Draft/BIM gate of its own).
11. **Rung 1** -- generated C++ dispatch for `call` members; the
    App-core severance.  **Rung 2** -- per-document guests.
12. **N5 / G6 / the switch** -- `Python/Runtime = pyodide`, Draft and BIM
    with an empty GUI island, the full Draft and BIM suites green with
    routing ON, the browser drawing a Draft line end to end.

Not on the roadmap: a socket-level host capability, UDP, listening
sockets, any network for the reference image, a webview escape hatch.

## 12. Traps

- A `FREECAD_USER_HOME` pointing at a nonexistent directory is silently
  ignored and writes the REAL `user.cfg`; an ad-hoc gate run once left
  `Enforce=0` there.
- The image directory is read-only after an install: the compiled
  module cache must live under `<user cache>`; its file name hashes the
  full image path (collision if two images share a base name).
- `libwasmtime.so` has no SONAME: `IMPORTED_NO_SONAME` is honoured only
  on a target CMake knows is SHARED.
- Two `nlohmann::json` copies collide on exported symbols carrying
  `json` in the signature.
- The v1 catalog ALLOWs addons: a refusal test needs a document
  principal.
- Pyodide's shell-mode `resolvePath` is the identity (5.4); a dev tree
  staging numpy beside the runtime makes an offer test pass vacuously.
- `ImageHost::evalExpression` must hold its `Security::Runtime::Scope`
  across the round trip, or a mid-evaluation bridge op (`pkg.missing`)
  has no principal unless an outer entry pushed one.
- The pyodide guest module must be `add_executable` with a `.so`
  suffix; `add_library(MODULE)` becomes an `emar` archive.
- Windows and macOS path handling in the pyodide scoping is by
  construction only; nothing ran there.
- `pre-commit` and `black` are not on this box's PATH.
- Two pre-existing, non-security bugs noted in passing and not fixed:
  `calc()`'s non-inplace `OP_MOD` branch also calls
  `PyNumber_InPlaceRemainder`; `ObjectIdentifier::Component::del`
  falls through to an unconditional throw after a successful delete.

## 13. Known gaps and open questions

- Not closed by the sandbox: `PropertyPythonObject::Restore`'s
  `PyImport_ImportModule` on a document-chosen module name
  (`PropertyPythonObject.cpp:379`) and `Base::Type::importModule`'s
  type-string import (`Type.cpp:85`), both at document OPEN, before any
  expression runs.  Rung 2 is where they close.
- The GUI live expression editors evaluate as session, unconfined.
- No memory ceiling for a guest.
- Addon principal granularity (per addon, per file?) is still open.
- Whether a document network grant may ever be "always" (a
  content-hashed identity makes it safe against tampering; a
  long-lived grant is still a long-lived channel).
- The PyPI resolver: host-side against PyPI's JSON API, or micropip in
  the guest with a host-fed index.
- Probe A's outcome (real Coin in the guest or a Coin-shaped model
  library); whether the mirror reader is the widget manager with a
  second model family; widget-protocol versioning between a shipped
  guest wheel and an older host (the manager refuses a newer major);
  the browser-only tier's rendering of the mirrored subset.
- The audit log's retention and where the Report view shows it; the
  addon manifest format.
